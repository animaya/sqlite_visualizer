  - table_count (integer)
  - is_valid (boolean)

- ✅ **SavedVisualizations**
  - id (primary key)
  - connection_id (foreign key)
  - name (text)
  - type (text) - chart type
  - config (text) - JSON configuration
  - table_name (text)
  - created_at (timestamp)
  - updated_at (timestamp)

  - config (text) - JSON template configuration
  - category (text)
  - is_default (boolean)

## API Endpoints

The application implements a comprehensive RESTful API:

### Connection Management
- ✅ `GET /api/connections` - List all saved connections
- ✅ `POST /api/connections` - Create a new connection
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id` - Get connection details
- ✅ `DELETE /api/connections/:id` - Remove a connection
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id/health` - Check database health/size

### Database Exploration
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id/tables` - List all tables in the database
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id/tables/:table/schema` - Get table schema
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id/tables/:table/data` - Get table data (with pagination)
- ✅ `GET /api/connections/:id/tables/:table/data/sample` - Get a sample of table data

### Visualization Management
- ✅ `POST /api/visualizations` - Create a new visualization
- ✅ `GET /api/visualizations` - List all saved visualizations
- ✅ `GET /api/visualizations/:id` - Get visualization details
- ✅ `PUT /api/visualizations/:id` - Update a visualization
- ✅ `DELETE /api/visualizations/:id` - Delete a visualization
- ✅ `GET /api/templates` - List all insight templates
- ✅ `GET /api/templates/:id` - Get template details
- ✅ `POST /api/templates/:id/apply` - Apply template to selected data

### Export Functionality
- ✅ `GET /api/export/csv/:vizId` - Export visualization as CSV
- ✅ `GET /api/export/csv/table/:connectionId/:tableName` - Export table as CSV

## Security Implementation

- ✅ Local network deployment with no external access
- ✅ Read-only database access to prevent data corruption
- ✅ Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Proper error handling to avoid exposing sensitive information
- ✅ Security headers with helmet middleware

## Deployment Configuration

The application can be deployed in the following ways:

1. **Development Mode**
   - Concurrent Node.js and React development servers
   - Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
   - Debug logging and detailed error reporting

2. **Production Mode**
   - Built React frontend served by Express
   - Optimized build with minimized assets
   - Graceful error handling for production environment
   - Port management to avoid conflicts

## Performance Optimizations

Several performance optimizations have been implemented:

- ✅ Efficient SQLite connection management
- ✅ Data pagination for large datasets
- ✅ Data sampling for visualization previews
- ✅ Client-side caching of frequently used data
- ✅ Optimized Chart.js configurations for rendering performance

## Next Steps and Future Improvements

While the core functionality is implemented, the following enhancements could be considered:
